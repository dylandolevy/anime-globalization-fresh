# Anime Globalization — Data + Analysis (2010–2025)

**Short:** Analysis of how global interest in Japanese pop culture (especially anime) evolved from 2010–2025 using MyAnimeList metadata and Google Trends.

**Author:** Dylan Dole-Vy (GitHub: [@dylandolevy](https://github.com/dylandolevy))  
**Status:** Working project — cleaned environment & notebooks (see `notebooks/`)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project builds a reproducible pipeline to:

- Clean and preprocess MyAnimeList metadata (`anime.csv`, `rating.csv`).
- Compute yearly metrics (titles produced, average score, membership).
- Pull Google Trends for *anime* (2010–2025) and aggregate to yearly.
- Merge and visualize global interest vs output, and compute correlations.
- Provide baseline predictive models for MAL score from metadata.

Notebook-driven, reproducible with a clean virtual environment.

## 🧰 Reproduce Locally


1. Clone \
    
    git clone https://github.com/dylandolevy/anime-globalization-fresh.git \
    cd anime-globalization-fresh 

2. Create & Activate Environment \
    
    python3 -m venv .venv \
    source .venv/bin/activate \
    pip install -r requirements.txt 


3. Jupyter Kernel \
    
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=anime-fresh --display-name "Python (anime-fresh)"


4. Place Raw Data \
    
    Put anime.csv (and rating.csv if using) into data/raw/ (not committed if large). \
    If you used Kaggle, keep kaggle.json at ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json. 


5. Run the Notebooks \
Open VS Code / Jupyter and run: \
    
    notebooks/02_cleaning_exploration.ipynb \
    notebooks/04_anime_modeling.ipynb \
    notebooks/06_trend_analysis.ipynb \

The notebooks will save processed CSVs to data/processed/ and figures to outputs/figures/. 

## Design Decisions & Notes
Raw large files are recommended to remain outside the repo. \
Use Git LFS for medium-large assets, or host raw data externally (Zenodo, Google Drive). \
Notebooks are the canonical analysis; the src/ folder contains reusable helpers. \
requirements.txt lists the package versions used for reproducibility. 


## Key Findings (Summary)
    Global search interest for “anime” rises sharply after 2015. \
    Anime production (titles per year) increases in parallel. \
    Strong positive correlation between production volume and search interest. 

## Results Overview
Global Growth of Anime (2010–2025) \
Visualizing global search interest for anime (Google Trends) versus the number of anime produced each year. \
Interest and production volume both rise sharply after 2015, signaling the global “anime boom.”
