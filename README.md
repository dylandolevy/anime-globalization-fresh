# Anime Globalization — Data + Analysis (2010–2025)

**Short:** Analysis of how global interest in Japanese pop culture (especially anime) evolved from 2010–2025 using MyAnimeList metadata and Google Trends.

**Author:** Dylan Dole-Vy (GitHub: [@dylandolevy](https://github.com/dylandolevy))  
**Status:** Working project — cleaned environment & notebooks (see `notebooks/`)

## 📘 Project Overview

This project builds a reproducible pipeline to:

- Clean and preprocess MyAnimeList metadata (`anime.csv`, `rating.csv`).
- Compute yearly metrics (titles produced, average score, membership).
- Pull Google Trends for *anime* (2010–2025) and aggregate to yearly.
- Merge and visualize global interest vs output, and compute correlations.
- Provide baseline predictive models for MAL score from metadata.

Notebook-driven, reproducible with a clean virtual environment.

## 🧰 Reproduce Locally

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylandolevy/anime-globalization-fresh.git
cd anime-globalization-fresh
2. Create & Activate Environment
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Jupyter Kernel
bash
Copy code
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=anime-fresh --display-name "Python (anime-fresh)"
4. Place Raw Data
Put anime.csv (and rating.csv if using) into data/raw/ (not committed if large).
If you used Kaggle, keep kaggle.json at ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json.

5. Run the Notebooks
Open VS Code / Jupyter and run:

text
Copy code
notebooks/02_cleaning_exploration.ipynb
notebooks/04_anime_modeling.ipynb
notebooks/06_trend_analysis.ipynb
The notebooks will save processed CSVs to data/processed/
and figures to outputs/figures/.

🧠 Design Decisions & Notes
Raw large files are recommended to remain outside the repo.
Use Git LFS for medium-large assets, or host raw data externally (Zenodo, Google Drive).

Notebooks are the canonical analysis; the src/ folder contains reusable helpers.

requirements.txt lists the package versions used for reproducibility.

✨ Key Findings (Summary)
Global search interest for “anime” rises sharply after 2015.

Anime production (titles per year) increases in parallel.

Strong positive correlation between production volume and search interest.

### ✅ Key fixes in this version:
1. Added **blank lines** between sections and code fences → GitHub Markdown renders correctly.  
2. Used **triple backticks with language hints** for code blocks.  
3. Wrapped text in consistent width and used `<p align="center">` only inside HTML blocks separated by blank lines.  
4. Added emoji section headers for clarity (works great on GitHub).  
5. Linked your username properly (`[@dylandolevy](https://github.com/dylandolevy)`).
